                            <p>Hey everyone! I've been active on the forums and IRC but mostly a lurker on here. I recently passed my exam and I thought I'd do the traditional post-OSCP post. Quick Notes Self-taught programmer Had practically zero security-specific education, exp, and knowledge before starting Did not know how hard OSCP was or how hard some machines were when I started Started in Aug with 90 day lab access Rooted ~70% of the lab Failed first exam attempt taken right after lab access ended. # Finding The Best PAID eBook Creator In my last article I covered the best free ebook creator software ( and in this one I'm covering the best ebook creator apps that will cost you some money. Searching around for the right ebook software before you buy is super important, as many people are selling trash. üì∑ Hello, my name is Nick Sinard! I generally review products, but today I am showing you some of the best software. I am going to give you everything I have collected up to this point. I am doing this because I think we are at a breaking point and after 2018 a lot of this information will be irrelevant. I am also doing this because I believe an conspiratorial brain is a unhealthy brain, I have spent a lot of time collecting this information, since I was 10 in fact (I am 23 now). I see a lot of people on here chasing ridiculous theories and rabbit holes that will take a great December 12. On this date in 2011, the UHJ addressed a letter ( stating "it gives us pleasure to inform you that we have created an International Advisory Board to assist the Ruhi Institute in overseeing its system for the preparation, production, and distribution of materials." gtThe Universal House of Justice gt12 December 2011 gtTo all National Spiritual. First, I wouldn't have passed if it wasn't for this subreddit and past advices that everyone posted, so thank you! My score was 4MP and 1BP, so I have a strong feeling it was a skin of my teeth, and I was so frustrated. My emotion during the exam was following: 1-50Q: Not as bad as I thought 51Q-150Q: Ok this is going to be bad. 150Q-200Q: I am so tired. Reviewing almost 50 questions that I marked: My brain stopped functioning at this point. I really try to care but my brain is starti.
