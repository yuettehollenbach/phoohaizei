                            <p> I’m playing Enigmatica 2 (https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/enigmatica2) for 1.12.2, and I’m getting pretty irritating frame time spikes when placing and breaking blocks in any chunks, even in complete wilderness. I’m also getting frame rate dips when in my base but not when I’m away from my base. Does anyone know what could possibly cause this and how I could fix this? I’ve tried removing Phosphor and OptiFine, update my graphics card drivers, rebooting my computer 
Lets say you play the witcher 3 and you are monitoring your frame times, do you have random frame time spikes while running around? What about when you pick up an item? Do you have a small frame time spike? (Which I assume is normal) I use msi afterburner to monitor this, I just want to know if frame time spikes every 1-2 minutes are normal or theres a problem. So Ive had my computer built since december, its a 2080 I7 9700k 1tb 860 evo ssd 16gb 3200mhz ram Aorus ultra Z390 gigabyte motherboard All my temps are fine, cloaks are fine, cpu and gpu usage seems fine, but I have frame time spikes in most games. Some more than others. Example: In the Witcher 3, even capping my fps, yes, I do have frametime spikes when I pick up items (which I assume is normal), but sometimes just runnig around I have those frame time spikes, and of course I’m playing Enigmatica 2 (https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/enigmatica2) for 1.12.2, and I’m getting pretty irritating frame time spikes when placing and breaking blocks in any chunks, even in complete wilderness. Does anyone know what could possibly cause this and how I could fix this? I’ve tried removing Phosphor and OptiFine, update my graphics card drivers, rebooting my computer, and more, but to no avail, unfortunately. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Here is my frame. So during my game I've noticed that my game will occasionally stutter. It doesn't make the game unplayable but often enough that I notice it and would like to fix it if possible. It happens in other games I have as well and just want to know if it's normal or if I can fix it https://i.imgur.com/I8AC5O8.png This is one of the instances that I caught but it will sometimes have 2 occurrences in the same graph https://i.imgur.com/7sR3bTZ.png This is another instance of it happening. Digital Foundry briefly mentioned uneven frame pacing in their PS Now analysis, and I seem to be experiencing something similar. They said it only happened with Killzone Shadowfall, but for me it happens with any game. After about 5-10 minutes of completely smooth gameplay, there will be about a period of 3 seconds where the video feed will noticeably stutter and then resume again as normal for another 5-10 minutes. It maintains this sort of cadence for the duration of a play session. I don't. Here's the photo of the spikes: https://imgur.com/a/klJfLi4 (https://imgur.com/a/klJfLi4) This was during fortnite if that matters. Anyone. 
When locked at 60fps or even 70 i get a look of spikes, like if my computer couldn't keep up with the performance needed, but the fps counter stays at 60. Happens in every game with various results, with WoW being the worst. It sucks when playing FPS games. Will a better monitor fix this issue, maybe freesync? or is this pc related? II have done a clean reinstall of windows and drivers and checked for temperature issues to no avail. The only option left seems to be upgrading something. After the new patch comes into play - that is, from the start of the new league the game is impossible for many. amp#x200B; https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2257418/page/4#p15997512 (https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2257418/page/4#p15997512) amp#x200B; This is the situation happening to more and more players. GGG ruined something in the new update - and a lot of people are waiting for repair. This does not allow a normal game. The situation happens to people. Hello everyone! I have a 2-year-old Lenovo ThinkPad P50 with 2 SSDs: a 256GB 950 PRO (x4 PCIe 3.0 NVMe, Windows 7 installed here, C: ) and a 1TB WD Blue SSD (SATA III, non-3D NAND, S: ) in the 2.5" slot. It's been a largely problem-free experience, except for this one which I've not been able to solve in two years. Windows Media Player (I'll call it WMP from here on) is installed in its factory-default location on C:. When I try to play any music or video file in S:, there Wondering if there's anything I can do to solve the frame time spikes? It gets really annoying when I'm running in the woods and just get a spike every now and then. Whenever the spike show up there's a hiccup on the screen and the fps drops. amp#x200B; It happens regardless of quality settings in game. Don't know if it's my hardware or the game itself. amp#x200B; Specs i5 8600k GTX 1070 Ti 16 gb ram Samsung Running an i5-3750K @ 4.6Ghz and a 1070 with 16GB RAM -- I'm getting frame spike issues. so even though I'm maintaining 80+ fps I get what feels like lag spikes. Anyone else seeing something similar. 
Has anyone had this issue/figured out a fix if there is one? My system is by no means a slouch, so it shouldn't be an issue there. I'm using x2 1080Tis, a R7 2700x, 32gb 3200Mhz ram. I've put the game on my NVMe drive since it seems to be using streaming textures, but it doesn't appear to help. I've tried with/without SLI and with/without my overclocks, but nothing seems to work. The game usings ~10gb of VRAM on both my GPUs, even though the game says it should only be using 4.8gb. I don't know how many times I've seen it over the years but Triangle is one of my favourite episodes. Some scenes, particularly with Anya, work so well that I still laughed out loud watching it just now. But the more you watch something the more you see things you missed before. When Buffy confronts Olaf in The Bronze, she gets thrown into Spike knocking them both to the floor. While they both struggle to get up, Spike has a quick feel of Buffy's boob. James Marsters is officially a legend A little bit of pee came out - I'm 40 and a gay girl, but squee!!!! https://imgur.com/a/Tm5SM. Is anyone else suffering from frame time spikes? I am getting spikes to around 40ms every 5 seconds. </p>
